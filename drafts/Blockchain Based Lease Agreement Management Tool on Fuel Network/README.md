# Blockchain Based Lease Agreement Management Tool on Fuel Network 

## Introduction
Lease Agreement Management is a crucial part of the real estate industry. It consists of handling every aspect of a lease agreement, from initial negotiation and tenant onboarding to rent collection, maintenance requests, and eventual lease renewal or termination. Just like in many other industries, auditability, immutability, and security are also important in the lease management industry.

In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and growing concerns over transparency, the emergence of blockchain technology has become a pathway for innovative solutions across various industries. Blockchain based Lease Agreement Management tools have introduced to address various weaknesses of traditional Lease Agreement Management approaches.

The main benefit of applying blockchain technologies is, it makes things more transparent  and significantly reduces the chances of fraud. Furthermore, the transactions are made quicker and benefits from trust and security. Since there are fewer middlemen and the process is more straightforward, transactions would also be less costly. 

When discussing blockchain based solutions, the solutions are directly impacted by the capabilities of the blockchain technologies used. In this article, we discuss how the powerful architectural features of Fuel Network, impact Blockchain-Based Lease Agreement Management Applications.

## Problems and Concerns that Lease Agreement Management Systems Deal With

First let’s summarize some of major problems and concerns that come out with Lease Agreement Management.

1.	Transparency
In Lease Agreement management systems, transparency is essential to creating trust, accountability, and smooth operations. Lack of transparency raises the risk of fraud, corruption, and illegal changes in land ownership. 


2.	Security
Ensuring the security of Lease Agreement Management application is important. While blockchain offers transparency, some lease data might be considered confidential (e.g. tenant personal information, financial details). Effective security measures should be taken to mitigate risks such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and tampering, thus upholding the integrity and confidentiality of lease-related information.

3.	Cost Factors
To start a transaction on blockchain, users need to establish a gas limit that is needed for the transaction to be successfully implemented. For a transaction-based application like a Lease Agreement Management System, maintaining low fee is important to keep user retention. Even with higher traffic, it will be important to manage a lower fee.

4.	Scalability
The scalability of a blockchain-based tool refers to its ability to handle an increasing amount of transactions or data without compromising performance or efficiency. In the context of Lease Agreement Management, scalability is essential as the volume of lease-related transactions and data can grow over time. Even in Ethereum blockchain, scalability is a problematic factor.

5.	Problem of Double Spending 
Double spending is a significant challenge in blockchain-based applications, including those used for Lease Agreement Management. It refers to the risk of spending the same cryptocurrency or digital asset more than once, which could lead to fraudulent transactions and undermine the integrity of the system. In the context of Lease Agreement Management, double spending refers to the possibility of a landlord fraudulently leasing the same property to two different tenants at the same time.

6.	Development Level Features
When it comes to a blockchain based solution, reliable and Faster Transaction Processing is very important. In order to provide such, the capabilities of undelaying development tools are also important. 

## How to Fuel Network's Capabilities are Applicable for Dealing with Problems and Concerns of Lease Agreement Management Systems 
1.	Transparency 
Transparency is inherited by default for fuel network as it uses a public ledger which records every transaction, and they are immutable. This creates a permanent and tamper-proof record of land ownership history. This is crucial in Lease Agreement Management as it prevents fraudulent changes to ownership records and ensures a clear audit trail for all stakeholders. 
Fuel uses UTXO fraud proofs. While transactions are generally assumed valid initially, anyone can later challenge a suspicious transaction. If someone attempts to manipulate records, others can step in and prove it with a fraud proof, upholding the integrity of the system.



2. Security
Fuel's unique feature is, its use of predicates. These are pre-defined conditions that must be met for a transaction to be finalized. In Lease Agreement Management, predicates could ensure proper approvals are in place before ownership changes are recorded. This adds an extra layer of security compared to traditional blockchains. 
Using the language features of sway, the smart contracts can generate errors and notifies the relevant Participants. Also can add transaction logs to trace useful intermediate non sensitive data.

3. Cost
Recall how Fuel separates tasks into a dedicated execution layer (FuelVM) and a separate layer for data storage. This modularity has a cost benefit. By offloading complex computations from the main blockchain to FuelVM, transaction fees associated with those computations are significantly lower even when high traffic.
4. Scalability
Unlike monolithic blockchains that handle everything at once, Fuel separates tasks. It has a dedicated execution layer (FuelVM) for processing transactions and a separate layer for data storage and security. This division allows FuelVM to handle many more transactions without slowing down the entire network.
Also the fraud proof indirectly causes the lower costs. It assumes transactions are valid by default but allows anyone to challenge them later if they're fraudulent. This eliminates the need for everyone to verify every transaction, reducing the load on the network.

5.	Problem of double spending 
Fuel relies on a system called the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model. Imagine each coin on the network has a unique fingerprint. To spend a coin, you need to prove you own it by showing where it came. This makes it very hard to fake ownership or spend a coin you don't have.

6.	Development Level Features
Fuel network comes with sway language which targets FuelVM which also a powerful tool for development. Developers can apply the advantages of parallel transaction execution and fraud-proofing capabilities to Lease Agreement Management System.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the adoption of blockchain technology in Lease Agreement Management offers numerous advantages, including increased transparency, reduced fraud risks, improved transaction efficiency, and enhanced security. However, several challenges such as scalability, security concerns, and regulatory frameworks need to be addressed for widespread implementation. The Fuel Network presents a promising solution to many of these challenges with its powerful architectural features. By leveraging public ledger technology and unique mechanisms like UTXO fraud proofs, modular execution and predicates, Fuel enhances transparency, security, and scalability in Lease Agreement Management Applications. Furthermore, its modular design and development tools provide developers with the flexibility and efficiency needed to build robust and secure Lease Agreement Management Systems. Overall, the Fuel Network demonstrates great potential in revolutionizing Lease Agreement Management practices and addressing the key concerns faced by traditional systems and tools based on Ethereum network.
